- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sambsquanch
- 👀 I’m interested in python3, cyber threat intel, osint, and other security related computer activities
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more blue team shit
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on threat research, python based osint script creation and red team CTFs preferably, but blue team CTFs will suffice
